# Variables and Types

#S we can do it this way as well:
# You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout:

my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)

# \n => new line 
print("\n\n-------------------- \n\n")

# We can define Strings in two different ways:

my_string = 'This string is using a single quote'
print(my_string)
my_string = "This string is using a double quotes"
print(my_string)

# but why ?
print("\nBut why not one way?")

string_with_quote = "\nDo't forgot to flush the toilet !!!"
print(string_with_quote)

# string_with_quote = 'Do't forgot to flush the toilet !!!'
# print(string_with_quote)

print("\n\n-------------------- \n\n")

# To define an integer, use the following syntax:
my_age = 20
print(my_age)
